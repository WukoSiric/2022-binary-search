# Binary Search Implementation 
Inputs: std::vector<int>, number 
Outputs: std::tuple<int index, int iterations_taken>

## Implementation Details
If the number isn't found it returns -1 for both ints in the tuple

## Future Plans
* Split create_vector function into separate helper file
* Convert into template so it can be used with different types of ints, or arrays even
